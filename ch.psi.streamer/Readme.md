#Overview
The streamer package provides an easy to use way to stream files from one location to an other via ZMQ.
It contains 2 applications, a simple receiver and a stream server. The stream server



# Usage

## Receiver
The file receiver can be started via the `receiver` script located in the `bin` folder. The receiver will store the files relatively to 
the directory from which the receiver script is started.

The usage of `receiver` is as follows:

```
Usage: receiver
 -h         Help
 -p <arg>   Source port (default: 8888)
 -s <arg>   Source address [required]
 -d <path>	Base path [required]
```

## Stream Server
The stream server can be started via the 'streamer' script located in the `bin` folder.

The usage of the `streamer` is as follows:

```
Usage: streamer
 -h         Help
 -p <arg>   Webserver port (default: 8080)
 -d <path>	Base path for monitoring files [required]
```

## Stream Server - UI
Streamer comes with a web UI. One can use this UI to list and manage current streams.
The web UI is accessible on `http://<host>:8080/static/` . Note: It is important to have the last / inside the url!
